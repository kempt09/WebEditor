1. Clone repo. 
2. Run npm install in your directory to obtain all the dev dependencies.
3. Edit the files in the src directory and then run Gulp. 
4. Gulp is already set up to output to the dist folder... Just run Gulp on the command line with the 'task'.
5. Use jade as the template language for HTML it is super easy to use and grasp.
6. Use Stylus so we don't have to use {} : ;
